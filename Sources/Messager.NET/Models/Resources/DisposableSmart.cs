/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This class provides a safe way to handle disposable resources by implementing
/// the "disposed" pattern and preventing duplicate disposal attempts. It wraps
/// an existing <see cref="IDisposable"/> instance and guarantees that the underlying
/// disposable is only disposed once, regardless of how many times the wrapper's
/// <see cref="Dispose"/> method is invoked.

	/// This method is thread-safe and idempotent. The first call to this method
	/// will dispose the wrapped disposable object, and any subsequent calls will
